- Write the obtained camera model, lens model, and notes to the **Comments** field of each photo's EXIF metadata.
- Write the predefined copyright notice to the **Copyright** field of each photo's EXIF metadata.
- If keywords are specified, write them into each photo's EXIF metadata.
- Geotag photos using the geographical coordinates of the specified city.
- Geotag photos using exact geographical coordinates and altitude.
- Merge multiple GPX tracks and geocorrelate photos using the resulting GPX file.
